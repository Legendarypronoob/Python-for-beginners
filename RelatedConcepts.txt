1.  What and how many paradigms are there in python? Give Advantages and disadvantages.
    ans : Programming paradigms are different ways or styles in which a given program or programming language can be organized.
          Each paradigm consists of certain structures, features, and opinions about how common programming problems should be tackled.
                python mainly supports 4 programming paradigms:
                    imperative programming paradigm:
                    procedural programming paradigm:
                        Advantages : General-purpose programming, Code re-usability, Portable source code.
                        Disadvantages : Data protection, Not suitable for real-world objects, Harder to write,
                    functional programming paradigm:
                        Advantages : Simple to understand, Making debugging and testing easier, Enhances the comprehension and readability of the code.
                        Disadvantages : Low performance, Writing programs is a daunting task, Low readability of the code.
                    object oriented-programming paradigm:
                        Advantages : Relation with Real world entities,Code re-usability,Abstraction or data hiding.
                        Disadvantages : Data protection, Not suitable for all types of problems, Slow Speed

2.  What is the difference between a module, library, package and framework?
    ans : a module is a piece of code that may be built upon, a package is a collection of modules,
          a library is a collection of pre-written code, and a framework is a set of principles for developing applications.

3.  What is the difference between mutable and immutable?
    ans : Mutable objects are those that allow you to change their value or data in place without affecting the object's identity.
          In contrast, immutable objects don't allow this kind of operation.
          You'll just have the option of creating new objects of the same type with different values.

4.  is python a case-sensitive language?
    ans : yes.

5.  What are arguments?
    ans : The terms parameter and argument can be used for the same thing. Information that are passed into a function.
