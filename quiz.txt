What is the super function?
ans: super functions are used to give access to methods of a parent class. Returns a temporary object of the parent class when used.

What is abstract classes?
ans: #abstract class = a class which contains one or more abstract methods.
#abstract method = a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation.

# prevents a user from creating an object of that class
# + compels a user to override abstract methods in a child class
kind of like interface implementation in java. opposite of super function when you think about it.

What is passing objects as arguments?
ans : to organize multiple things in a specific category we pass arguments as objects to the class and reuse the objects return types of that class.

What is duck typing?
ans : # duck typing = concept where the class of an object is less important than the methods/attributes
#class type is not checked if minimum methods/attributes are present
#“If it walks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.”

What is the Walrus operator :- ?
ans : # assignment expression aka walrus operator
# assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression

Can you assign in-built functions to a variable in python?
ans : yes.Though it's not really demanding.

What is a higher order function?
ans : #  Higher Order Function =  a function that either:
#                           1. accepts a function as an argument
#                               or
#                           2. returns a function
#                           (In python, functions are also treated as objects)

What is lamda in python?
ans :
# lambda function = function written in 1 line using lambda keyword
#                   accepts any number of arguments, but only has one expression.
#                   (think of it as a shortcut)
#                   (useful if needed for a short period of time, throw-away)
#
# lambda parameters:expression

What can you do with sort() method in python?
ans : # sort() method   = used with lists
# sort() function = used with iterables

What is a map function?
ans : # map() =   applies a function to each item in an iterable (list, tuple, etc.)
#
# map(function,iterable)

What is the filter function in python?
ans : # map() =   applies a function to each item in an iterable (list, tuple, etc.)
#
# map(function,iterable)

What is reduce() in python?
ans : # reduce() = apply a function to an iterable and reduce it to a single cumulative value.
#            performs function on first two elements and repeats process until 1 value remains
#
# reduce(function, iterable)

What is list comprehension?
ans : list comprehension =  a way to create a new list with less syntax
#                       can mimic certain lambda functions, easier to read
#                       list = [expression for item in iterable]
#                       list = [expression for item in iterable if conditional]
#                       list = [expression if/else for item in iterable]
